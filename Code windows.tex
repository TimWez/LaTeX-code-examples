% This files contains the needed packages and definitions to create a code environment(minted) in a tcolorbox.
% This is a minimalist example, and may need some changes for your particular use case.

% When using overleaf everything should be fine. If you compile LaTeX localy, make sure to pass the --shell-escape as a custom compiler argument.
